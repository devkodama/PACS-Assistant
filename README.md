# PACS Assistant

## Introduction

PACS Assistant is intended to make the combination of Agfa Enterprise Imaging (EI), PowerScribe, and Epic work together more seamlessly and efficiently. It performs multiple functions which are described below.

PACS Assistant is highly customizable. Most functions can be selectively enabled or disabled.


## Single sign on

PACS Assistant can streamline PACS start up especially when reading remotely. At home, with a click of the **Power** button and entry of a one time passcode, it will connect the VPN and start up EI, Powerscribe, and Epic, leaving you ready to start dictating. At the hospital, it will simply start up EI, Powerscribe, and Epic.

After startup, PACS Assistant will resize and reposition your windows to your desired layout.

At home, your username and password are securely stored so you don't have to reenter them every time. At the hospital, only your username is stored--you will have to provide your password the first time you start up.


## Window focus

PACS Assistant lets you treat EI, PowerScribe, and Epic as though they were integrated instead of being three separate applications. You no longer have to click simply to change focus between application windows. By following your mouse on the screen, PACS Assistant determines your intention and treats keyboard and mouse inputs accordingly.

For example, if `C` is mapped to the Caliper tool, then pressing `C` while the mouse is over the EI image windws will activate the Caliper tool. However, pressing `C` while the mouse is over the PowerScribe report window will type the letter *C* into your report. No mouse click is necessary to change which window is in focus.

Within EI, PACS Assistant also helps with keeping the proper viewport in focus. For example, if the `1` key is mapped to Window/Level Preset #1, then pressing `1` will cause window/level to affect the viewport under the mouse rather than the last viewport you clicked in or scrolled.


## PowerScribe shortcuts

PACS Assistant provides several keyboard shortcuts for working with PowerScribe, described below. These shortcuts work whether the mouse is over the PowerScribe, EI, or EPIC windows.

### Microphone on/off

The CapsLock key turns the microphone on and off.

Shift-CapsLock signs the current report.

Ctrl-CapsLock drafts the current report.

Shift-Ctrl-CapsLock makes the current report preliminary.

Alt-CapsLock toggles the caps lock state (i.e. the original function of the CapsLock key).

### Next/Previous field

The Tab key moves to the next PowerScribe field.

Shift-Tab moves to the previous PowerScribe field.

Ctrl-Tab moves the cursor to the end of the current line. Pressing it again moves the cursor to the end of the line below.
