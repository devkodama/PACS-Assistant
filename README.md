# PACS Assistant

## Introduction

PACS Assistant helps Agfa Enterprise Imaging (EI), PowerScribe, and Epic function more seamlessly and efficiently.

PACS Assistant has many features which are described below. PACS Assistant is highly customizable--most of its features can be selectively enabled or disabled from the Settings page.

## How to use

On home workstations, copy the PACS Assistant folder to the Documents folder. Open the PACS Assistant folder and double click "Run PACS Assistant" to start it. You can create a desktop shortcut to make it easier to run next time.

On hospital workstations, copy the PACS Assistant folder to the Documents folder. Open the PACS Assistant folder and double click "Run PACS Assistant" to start it. You cannot create a persistent desktop shortcut on hospital workstations.

The first time you run PACS Assistant, you'll need to enter your username and password. On home workstations, it will remember your username and password so you don't have to enter it in the future. Your password is protected by your Windows login password. On hospital workstations, PACS Assistant will remember your username but not your password for security reasons.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Your stored username and password are protected by your Windows login credentials. Anyone who knows your Windows login can access your stored username and password.

## Single sign on

On home workstations, PACS Assistant can complete the sequence of connecting to the VPN and starting EI, Powerscribe, and Epic with minimal input. To begin, click on the **Power** button, wait a few seconds, and enter a one time passcode from the Authenticate app on your mobile phone. The rest happens automatically.

On hospital workstations, PACS Assistant can start EI, Powerscribe, and Epic, but you will have to enter your password the first time. Your password is not stored for security reasons.

## Window management

PACS Assistant can remember your window layout and restore windows to the same positions when PACS starts up.

PACS Assistant can automatically dismiss selected popup messages, such as the PowerScribe, EI, or Epic confirmation messages.

## Focus following

PACS Assistant treats EI, PowerScribe, and Epic as though they were integrated instead of being separate applications. PACS Assistant watches your mouse and keeps the appropriate application in focus. You don't need to click on each application to switch focus.

In most cases, key presses are transmitted to the application which has focus. However, when appropriate, some keys may be transmitted to a different application.

> For example, if the Tab key is assigned to the PowerScribe command "Next Field", pressing Tab will send a "Next Field" command to PowerScribe regardless of whether the mouse is hovering over the PowerScribe window or over an EI image window.

## Viewport activation for EI

PACS Assistant can activate the EI viewport under the mouse pointer when certain EI keyboard shortcuts are pressed. You don't need to click to change the active viewport before you press the shortcut key.

> For example, if the `W` key is mapped to EI Rotate image, pressing the `W` key will first activate the viewport under the mouse pointer and *then* rotate the image, since that is what you likely intended.

In order to enable this functionality, you first need to tell PACS Assistant ([wip] via Settings) which shortcut keys are mapped to which tools in EI.

## New keyboard shortcuts

PACS Assistant provides several new keyboard shortcuts for working with PowerScribe and EI. Most of these keys work when the mouse is hovering over the Powerscribe, EI, and sometimes Epic windows.

### CapsLock key

**CapsLock** toggles the microphone on and off.

**Shift-CapsLock** can do one of several things:

* If a report is currently being dictated, signs the report. Equivalent to the PowerScribe *Sign* button (F4).

* If a study is open and ready for dictation, then start (or resume) dictation. Equivalent to the EI *Start* (or *Resume*) *reading* button.

* If the open study is not ready for dictation or if there is no open study, and if one or more studies are selected on the EI List page, then start dictation of the selected studies. Equivalent to the EI *Start* (or *Resume*) *reading* button.

* If no studies are selected studies on the EI List page, then start dictation of all the studies on the worklist. Equivalent to the EI *Start list* button.

**Ctrl-CapsLock** saves the report currently being dictated as a Draft. Equivalent to the PowerScribe *Draft* button (F12).

**Shift-Ctrl-CapsLock** signs the report currently being dictated as Preliminary. Equivalent to the PowerScribe *Prelim* button.

**Alt-CapsLock** toggles the caps lock state (*i.e.* the original function of the CapsLock key).

### Tab key

**Tab** moves to the next field in a PowerScribe report.

**Shift-Tab** moves to the previous field in a PowerScribe report.

**Ctrl-Tab** moves the cursor to the end of the current line in a PowerScribe report. Pressing it a second time moves the cursor down one line then to the end of the line.

> üí° This can be useful to position the cursor *after* the default text when tabbing into a field so that dictation does not replace the default text.

**Shift-Ctrl-Tab** moves the cursor up one line, then to the end of the line.

### ` (Backtick or tilde) key

**Backtick** brings up the report for the comparison study (equivalent to clicking on the Display Study Details button in the upper right corner of a viewport), switching to the Text page of the EI desktop if necessary.

Pressing it again brings up the report of a second comparison study if one is being displayed on the screen. If no second comparison study is displayed, it brings up the empty report of the active study.

**Shift-Backtick** toggles between the List and Text pages of the EI Desktop.

**Ctrl-Backtick** brings up the Search page of the EI Desktop. Pressing it a second time clears the search fields and puts the cursor in the Patient last name field, ready for entering a new search.

### Spacebar

The **Spacebar** can do one of several things:

* While scrolling through images in EI with the left mouse button down, pressing **Spacebar** engages Click Lock, allowing the left mouse button to be physically released. Pressing **Spacebar** again disengages Click Lock. Pressing either mouse button also disengages Click Lock.

* When the mouse pointer is over an EI image window, pressing **Spacebar** performs a double-click. This is useful to enlarge or restore the size of a series, or if the mouse pointer is over a series thumbnail to put the series into the active viewport.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Known issue: In some places, the spacebar no longer works to type a space. For example, when creating a text annotation on an image, the space bar will send a double-click which leads to unwanted side effects. If you need to type a space, you can press **Shift-Spacebar** to enter a space, or temporarily disable PACS Assistant while you are typing.

* When the mouse pointer is over the EI desktop List page, pressing **Spacebar** performs a double-click. This can be used to open a study, for example.

### Escape key

**Shift-Esc** closes the current case in EI when the mouse pointer is over an EI image window (same as clicking the EI *Remove from list* button).

### Ctrl-Z / Ctrl-Y

**Ctrl-Z** and **Ctrl-Y** send *Undo* and *Redo* commands, respectively, to PowerScribe.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Disable this if you have Ctrl-Z or Ctrl-Y mapped as EI shortcuts (or remap your EI shortcuts).

## Miscellaneous functions

### Microphone auto on/off ###

PACS Assistant can automatically turn on the microphone when you open a report for dictation, and turn it off when you close it. It can also automatically turn off the microphone after a period of inactivity (*e.g.* if you leave your workstation).

### Mouse jiggler

PACS Assistant can jiggle the mouse periodically in order to suppress the Windows screensaver and prevent the screen from turning off.

### CapsLock autooff

PACS Assistant returns the CapsLock state to off after a short period of time (around 10 seconds).

## Comments

PACS Assistant is optimized for a handsfree setup, *i.e.* a handsfree microphone, right hand on the mouse, and left hand on the keyboard.

If frequently used EI keyboard shortcuts are mapped to the left half of the keyboard, then reading can be done with minimal hand movements and without needing to look away from the screen.

PACS Assistant can be used with an accessory keypad such as a Tartarus gaming keypad by reassigning its functions to different keys. I've found that I prefer using the regular keyboard because it is available on any workstation without the need to plug in an accessory keypad.

PACS Assistant is still under development with more features to come. You may (will) encounter bugs or conflicts with other applications; in most cases, temporariliy disabling PACS Assistant can bypass the problem.

Feedback is welcome, let me know of issues you encounter or new features you'd like to see.
