PS login, main, report, addendum share the same HWND
-> need daemon to monitor for switches between these windows and call PA hooks
PS other windows have different HWND


EI d, i1, i2, chat have different HWND
EI popup messages have different HWND
-> may need to parse title bar and content of message box to decipher message


EPIC main and chat have different HWND
-> need daemon to monitor for switches of main between login, timezone, chart and call hooks

Windows with unique hwnd are detected by WinEvent system. Callbacks are registered with and called by WinEvent system

Windows that share the same hwnd are really pseudowindows and are not handled by the WinEvent system. For PS and EPIC, it is necessary for the daemon to monitor for changes in pseudowindow state and to initiate callbacks. For EI, it isn't really necessary to constantly monitor pseudowindow switches.

Callbacks should prevent reentry?


WinEvent.Show:
  Saves the hwnd of the newly shown window in the Win object. If the window is not a listed window of interest, adds the hwnd to a generic list of hwnd for the App object
  Fires the PA callback if any.

WinEvent.Close
  Removes the saved hwnd from the Win object. Fires the PA callback if any.
